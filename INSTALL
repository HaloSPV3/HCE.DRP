# INSTALLATION

HCE.DRP is officially distributed with Halo SPV3; however, to
install it:

1. Open/Extract the Zip archive.
2. Copy "HCE.DRP.dll" to Halo's...
    - ..."Controls" folder if you do *not* have [Chimera](https://github.com/SnowyMouse/chimera/) installed.
    - ..."mods" folder if you *do* have [Chimera](https://github.com/SnowyMouse/chimera/) installed. You can copy almost any DLL to Chimera's mods directory, including ReShade.

Todo

- distribute via HXE

## UPDATING

For now, compare the current File Version against the latest release's version.
When an update is available, install the new file as you would normally and overwrite the old DLL if needed.
